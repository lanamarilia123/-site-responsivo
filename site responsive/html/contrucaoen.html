    <h3 class="p3"> • How was Christ made? •  </h3>
   <p class="textos">
    It all started in 1859, when the French lazarist priest Pierre-Marie Boss, from the Igreja do Colégio Imaculada Conceição, had the dream of building a religious monument on top of Mount Corcovado, which is 710 meters high. The priest recorded this idea in the book "Imitation of Christ", from 1903.
   </p>

   <p class="textos">
    
The priest's proposal began to materialize in the preparations for the centenary of the Independence of Brazil, celebrated in 1922. A year before, a dispute was opened between the projects for the monument. The winner was Heitor da Silva Costa.

    At the same time, more than 22,000 women signed a petition asking the president of Brazil at the time, Epitácio Pessoa, for authorization to build the monument.
    The idea was that the Christ would be built only with donations from Brazilians. For this purpose, in 1923, the Archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro launched the Monument week, in which thousand contos de réis were raised. Years later, new collections were made. In total, the construction cost 2,500 contos de reis, which is equivalent to R$ 9.5 million.
   </p>
    <p class="textos">
        The monument was built in Brazil, except for the head and hands, which were molded in Paris, France. Christ's body was made of soapstone, which was cut into thousands of triangles. They were glued by hand onto fabric and then applied to the statue by pastileiros.
    </p>

    <p class="textos">
        The only part designed for the interior of the construction is the heart of Christ the Redeemer, which measures 1.30 meters. The interior is made up of 12 plateaus, connected by staircases, forming floors that open at the arms and head. The monument is prepared to withstand winds of up to 250 km/h

    To get to the monument, patience and willingness are needed, as the tour can take a few hours, especially if it is on the weekend or on holidays. You can go by train, van or on foot. Opening hours are from 8am to 7pm. There is an entrance fee.
