    1 - Christ the Redeemer is one of the seven wonders of the world
 </h2>   

    <p class="textos">
        Starting with a well-known fact, but which still raises doubts in many locals and tourists. Yes, Christ the Redeemer is among the seven wonders of the world, along with
        with the Taj Mahal, in India, the Colosseum, in Italy, and the Great Wall of China.
        One of the curiosities about Christ the Redeemer is that the statue received that title in 2007, but,
         in 2012, it was also considered a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Deserves it, doesn't it?  
    </p>

<h2 class="p2">    
    2 – It is the largest art deco statue in the world
</h2>

    <p class="textos">
        Not only is Christ the Redeemer on the list of the seven wonders of the world, it is also one of the largest statues ever built. If you only consider the art deco style, there is nothing for anyone: Christ the Redeemer is at the top of the list.</p>
    <p class="textos">
        After all, its dimensions are really impressive. Christ the Redeemer is 38 meters high, including the pedestal, measures 28 meters from one hand to the other and weighs 1,145 tons.
        And more curiosities about Christ the Redeemer: the monument is at the top of Morro do Corcovado, 710 meters above sea level.</p>

    3 – Christ the Redeemer was not built in Brazil</h2>

    <p class="textos">
        Although the monument is a Brazilian project for Rio de Janeiro, the statue
        of Christ the Redeemer was not sculpted in Brazil, but in France.
    </p>
    <p class="textos">
        It began to be designed in 1922, by the Brazilians Heitor da Silva Costa and Carlos Oswald, the French sculptors Paul Landowski and Albert Caquot, and the Romanian Gheorghe Leonida, who sculpted the face.
        Christ the Redeemer was inaugurated on October 12, 1931.

    4 – The statue was separated into pieces to arrive in Brazil
</h2>
    <p class="textos">
        With all its dimensions and located at the highest point of the city, it was impossible to bring Christ the Redeemer in its entirety from France to Rio de Janeiro.
        Therefore, the statue was divided into several pieces, which were transported to the top of Corcovado by train – which still works today!
    </p>
    <p class="textos">
        To avoid any damage, the team led by engineer Heitor Levy was responsible for placing the statue and had about a thousand people, including workers, architects and engineers.

    5 – The statue of Christ the Redeemer has a heart – and a curious story
</h2>
    <p class="textos">
        Few people know, but Christ the Redeemer has a heart, which can be seen both outside and inside the statue. It is 1.30 meters tall, made of soapstone, the same material as the statue, and has a hollow interior. There's more: inside that heart, there's a bottle with the family tree of Heitor Levy, the engineer mentioned above.
    </p>
    <p class="textos">
        That's because, at the time of construction, Levy, who was Jewish, had a car accident. But, for escaping with his life, he converted to Catholicism and placed the bottle inside, as a sign of his faith.
    </p>

    <h2 class="p2">
        6 – Christ the Redeemer resists a hurricane, but suffers from lightning
</h2>   
    <p class="textos">
        You can even try, but nothing moves Christ the Redeemer, not even a hurricane! Yes, the largest art deco statue in the world withstands winds of up to 250 km/h, which is equivalent to a category hurricane.
    </p>
   
    <p class="textos">
        However, Christ the Redeemer suffers from the rays. According to a survey by Superinteressante magazine, lightning strikes the monument, on average, six times a year. In addition, this number can increase to 20 times a month, in times of storms. Therefore, there is a crown of thorns on top of the head, which serves as a lightning rod, so as not to damage the structure.
